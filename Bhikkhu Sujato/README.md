I just modified the text alignment from *left* to *justify*, and then converted from epub to azw3 and mobi, using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

In addition, I applied soft hyphenation on azw3 files using [Hyphenate This!](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=208534) Calibre plugin.
